# Advent Of Code 2020

All about the challenge [here](https://adventofcode.com)

Dear Santa, 

All I want this Christmas is to improve my JavaScript skills.
But don't worry Santa, I know this is something that only I can gift myself.
So I'm going to give the Advent of Code a go and see how far I can get.
